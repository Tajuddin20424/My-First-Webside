paragraph tag: <p>html means hypertext markup language</p>
<p>In 1980, <strong>physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN,</strong> proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, <b>a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989,</b> Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified <i> HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.</i> That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, <em>Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is</em> used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]</p>
